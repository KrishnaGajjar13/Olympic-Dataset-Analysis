The Olympic Dataset project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the dataset containing information about athletes who participated in the Olympic Games. The dataset includes detailed attributes for each athlete such as their unique identifier, name, gender, age, height, weight, the team they represent, National Olympic Committee (NOC) code, the specific Olympic Games they participated in, the year, season, host city, sport category, specific event, and any medals won.

Here are the question answered using the source code from dataset:

**Basic Questions**

1. Data Exploration: How many rows and columns does the dataset have?
2. Unique Values: How many unique sports are there in the dataset?
3. Gender Distribution: What is the distribution of male and female athletes?
4. Age Statistics: What are the minimum, maximum, and average ages of the athletes?
5. Medal Count: How many medals were won in total? Break it down by Gold, Silver, and Bronze.
6. Top Teams: Which team has the most athletes represented?
7. Missing Data: Which columns have missing values, and how many?



**Intermediate Questions**

8. Height and Weight Distribution: What is the distribution of heights and weights of the athletes? Use histograms for visualization.
9. Age Distribution by Gender: Plot the age distribution for male and female athletes.
10. Medals by Country: Which country has won the most medals? Create a bar chart.
11. Height vs. Weight: Create a scatter plot to show the relationship between height and weight.
12. Age vs. Medals: Is there a correlation between the age of athletes and the number of medals won?
13. Participation Over Time: How has the number of participating athletes changed over the years?
14. Top Sports: Which sports have the most athletes? Create a bar chart.
15. City Hosting: How many times has each city hosted the Olympics?

**Advanced Questions(Optional)**

16. Medals by Season: Compare the number of medals won in Summer vs. Winter Olympics.
17. Team Performance: Analyse the performance of top teams over different years.
18. Height and Weight Over Time: How have the average height and weight of athletes changed over the years?
19. Medal Predictions: Can you predict the likelihood of winning a medal based on age, height, weight, and gender using a logistic regression model?
20. Clustering Sports: Use clustering techniques (like K-Means) to group sports based on the physical attributes (height, weight, age) of their athletes.
